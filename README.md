# The Tone Geek | Fairfield County Signature Project
Documentation and resources for my Fairfield County Signature project. Compare the project to a Two-Rock John Mayer Signature. This *ReadMe* is more or less a table of contents for all of the information about the build in a single place versus replicated information that is at risk of being out of sync between my website and GitHub.
